# Professional Certificate in RAG and Agentic AI

## Program Overview

Welcome to this overview of the Professional Certificate in RAG and Agentic AI. AI is evolving beyond traditional models, enabling smarter applications. Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, enhances AI's ability to provide accurate, context-aware responses by integrating real-time information retrieval. 

Multimodal AI is another advancement that allows systems to process and integrate various types of data – text, images, audio, and video – enabling more dynamic and interactive user experiences. 

Agentic AI represents a further shift, equipping systems with the ability to reason, plan, and autonomously execute tasks. While each of these approaches can work independently, they can also be combined to create more powerful and adaptable AI systems. 

Through this program, you'll gain the expertise to build and implement AI applications that combine these powerful techniques, preparing you for the next wave of AI-driven innovation.

Whether you're looking to advance in software engineering, machine learning, or data science, mastering RAG, Multimodal, and Agentic AI will give you a competitive edge in the evolving job market.
